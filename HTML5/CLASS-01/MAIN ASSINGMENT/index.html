    <p>The main parts of our element are as follows: The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect ----- in this case where the paragraph begins. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends ---- in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results. The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</p>
